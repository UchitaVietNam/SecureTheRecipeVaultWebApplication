# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Restrict SSH access from the public internet to EC2 instances.
2. Prevent root account login via SSH.
3. Configure the use of complex passwords - over 8 characters and include specific characters, avoiding password reuse.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- Utilize the principle of least privilege for the current role's permissions, allowing access only to specific groups rather than using wildcard characters (*). Policy conditions can also be enforced.
- For enhanced protection of S3 bucket contents:
  - Enable server-side encryption feature on the S3 bucket.
  - Restrict the role profile's permissions to read-only from S3 until the application requires write access.
