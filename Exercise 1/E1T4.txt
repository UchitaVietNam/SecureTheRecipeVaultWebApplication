Based on the architectural diagram and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the web application service, identify at least 4 security practices that are less clear. Include a rationale.

1. IAM role has administrative access to the S3 group. This should be avoided to enhance security. 

2. WebAppSG is open to allow access from multiple ports from the internet to the WebSevice version within the public subnet. Instead, the web service should be in a private subnet. This service should be within a private subnet and use port 443 instead of 80 to ensure SSL termination from AppLoadBalancerSG to the instance.

3. Default private routes have a destination CIDR to the internet, allowing malicious resources in the private subnet to communicate with any endpoint on the internet.

4. All S3 buckets are not encrypted, and the block public access is also disabled, so anyone can access and view all objects within those buckets.
